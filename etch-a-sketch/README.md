And yet another Project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/)
Goal this time was create, at first, a 16x16 grid in which each cell changed color to black once the mouse was over it. Then it was extended with a button for changing the grid size and another one for changing the color to a random one instead of black.
