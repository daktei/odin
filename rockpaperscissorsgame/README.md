Goal from this project was, at first, to create a functonal Rock Paper Scissors Game against the Computer, only on the Console log without any type of GUI. Later on the game code was modified in order to create it with a GUI.
This Project no doubt helped me reinforce my (little) knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript.
