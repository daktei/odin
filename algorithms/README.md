This are the Data Structures and Algorithms Exercises from the Odin Project. (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms)

Binary trees

Here the assignment was to build a simple Binary Tree.

Knight's Travails

Goal from this project was to find a good algorithm, which calculates the
shortest path for a Knight betwenn two positions on a Chess Board.
I measured the time from my two algorithms, apparently  a BFS Algorithm looks clearly
faster than a DFS. 
In this Program the user should input a start and end position. The output would look like(from [0,0] to [7,7]:
  "You made it in 6 moves! The path was:
   0, 0
   2, 1
   4, 2
   6, 3
   4, 4
   6, 5
   7, 7"
